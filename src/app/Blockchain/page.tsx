You can use it to pay friends for your share of the bar tab, buy that new pair of socks you've been eyeing up üëÄ, or book flights ‚úàÔ∏è and hotels üè® for your next holiday. Because cryptocurrency is digital, it can also be sent to friends and family anywhere in the world..

        <p className="pt-3 text-lg">ERC-20 is the technical standard for fungible tokens created using the Ethereum blockchain. A fungible token is interchangeable with another token‚Äîwhere the well-known non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are not interchangeable.
        ERC-20 allows developers to create smart-contract-enabled tokens that can be used with other products and services. These tokens are a representation of an asset, right, ownership, access, cryptocurrency, or anything else that is not unique in and of itself but can be transferred.
