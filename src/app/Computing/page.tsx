        <h1 className=" pt-5 font-bold text-2xl ">| Introduction to Cloud Native Computing</h1>
        <p className="pt-3 text-lg ">Cloud native computing uses open-source software stacks to deploy applications as microservices, packaging each part into its own container and dynamically orchestrating those containers to optimize resource utilization. In the last 15 years, cloud application delivery has moved from being bound to physical servers to running on virtual machines with a full operating system and now to containers with Docker, where developers can specify every aspect of deployment.

       <p className="pt-3 text-lg">Linux containers are poised to take over the world; we will start our course with an introduction of Linux and the command line. For many non-technical people, the command line (also referred to as CLI, Terminal, bash, or shell) is a place of mystery. However, you only have to know a handful of basic commands to start feeling comfortable. In this module we will cover the basic commands to get you started.

        <p className="pt-3 text-lg">This course provides a soup-to-nuts learning experience for core Docker technologies, including the Docker Engine, Images, Containers, Registries, Networking, Storage, and more. All of the behind the scenes theory is explained, and all concepts are clearly demonstrated on the command line. No prior knowledge of Docker or Linux is required.

        <p className="pt-3 text-lg">In this quarter we will develop an understanding of core cloud native services, uses, and architecture best practices. We will develop proficiency in developing, deploying, and debugging cloud native applications using Istio, Knative, Prometheus, NATS, and TiKV, etc. We will also focus on understanding of application lifecycle management, ability to use a CI/CD pipeline to deploy applications, and ability to write code using cloud native security best practices.
